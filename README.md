As an aspiring engineer and computer scientist, I enjoy solving problems at the intersection of mechanical design and computing. 
I think that engineering is at its best when it has a positive impact on the people who interact with their products, whether it 
be through protecting the environment, improving access to important services, uplifting the disadvantaged, or even just making 
someone smile. I have experience with mechanical and software design, with emphasis on design of 3D printed components and robotic systems.
